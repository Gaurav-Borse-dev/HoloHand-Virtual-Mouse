# HoloHand-Virtual-Mouse
HoloHand is an AI-powered gesture control system built with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI. It lets you control your computer using hand movements — move cursor, scroll, swipe, zoom, and play/pause — all through real-time gesture recognition for a smooth, touchless experience.
🖐️ HoloHand – Gesture-Controlled Human-Computer Interaction System

HoloHand is an advanced AI-powered gesture recognition system that bridges the gap between human motion and digital control — turning your hands into a natural interface for computers.

Built using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI, HoloHand enables users to control their laptop seamlessly through real-time hand gestures — no mouse, no keyboard, just motion.

🚀 Key Features

🖱️ Cursor Control: Move your hand to guide the cursor with precision.

🎬 Play/Pause Gesture: Pause or play media with an open-palm still gesture.
